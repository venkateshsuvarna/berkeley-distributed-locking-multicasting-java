README FILE

1st Part of Project(Berkeley's Algorithms):

Open 3 command prompts, and then run the file RMIServer.java in one of the command prompts, and enter the Server's initial logical clock time.

How to run Java File in Windows:
>javac <filename>.java
>java <filename> OR java <filename>.class

Then open the other two command prompts and then enter the first and the second client's initial logical clock respectively. Then the server will automatically adjust the logical clock of itself and the clients by performing calculation according to Berkeley's algorithm.

2nd part of project(Multicasting of Messages using Lamport's logical clock):

This part of the project is being implemented in Python. Directly run the files client1.py, client2.py and client3.py by double clicking on the file. The program running is self-explainatory.


3rd part of project(Distributive Locking):

This part of the project is being implemented in Python. Directly run the files client1.py , client2.py and client3.py by double clicking on the file. The files config.py, lock.txt and sharedfile.txt should be in the same directory as the client files client1.py, client2.py and client3.py
